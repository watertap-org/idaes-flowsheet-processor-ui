# idaes-flowsheet-processor-ui

This repository is for work on the user interface (UI) for the IDAES Flowsheet Processor.
The UI installer can be downloaded from our homepage at: https://watertap-org.github.io/

## Getting started (developer)

### Prerequisites

The following steps assume that:

1. `conda` is already installed and configured
2. This repository (i.e. https://github.com/watertap-org/idaes-flowsheet-processor-ui) has been cloned locally and the working directory is set to the root of the repository

## Installation

### 1. Creating the Conda environment

Run the following command to create and activate a new Conda environment named `flowsheet-processor-env`:

```sh
conda env create --file environment.yml && conda activate flowsheet-processor-env
```

This will install the correct runtime versions of both the backend (Python) and frontend (NodeJS) portions of the UI, as well as the backend (Python) dependencies.

### 2. Install the JavaScript dependencies

Run the following command to install the JavaScript dependencies:

```sh
npm --prefix frontend clean-install
```

### 3. Install the IDAES solver dependencies

```sh
idaes get-extensions --verbose
```

# Running the UI

### Ensure that the `flowsheet-processor-env` Conda environment is active and all dependencies are installed

```console
conda activate flowsheet-processor-env
```

### Run UI in browser

```console
cd <idaes-flowsheet-processor-ui-path>/frontend
npm run app-start
```

# Running developer tests

There are three sets of tests that can be run: Python tests, JavaScript unit tests, and JavaScript end-to-end tests.

## Running Python tests

From the repository root directory run:

To run:
```shell
cd backend/src/idaes_flowsheet_processor_ui
pytest
```

This will take several minutes since one set of tests solves the UI flowsheets.

## Running JS unit tests

The unit tests are written using the [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/) package.

To run:
```shell
cd frontend
npm run test
```

Hit 'a' for "run all tests" if you want to run tests regardless of what changed.

## Running JS E2E tests

The end-to-end tests are written in Cypress.

Before running the tests, start the app, in another process (or shell):
```shell
cd frontend
npm run app-start
```

Then, to run the tests:
```shell
cd frontend
npx cypress run
```

If there are errors, screenshots and videos can be found (in subdirectories named for each test) under `electron/ui/cypress/screenshots` and `electron/ui/cypress/videos`.
