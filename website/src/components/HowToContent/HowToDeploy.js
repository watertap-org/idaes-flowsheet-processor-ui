                The IDAES Flowsheet Processor is deployable into a desktop application compatible with either Windows or MacOS (ARM64) operating systems. The application can be deployed into one of three different versions: WaterTAP, IDAES, or PrOMMIS. Each version comes with a custom styling and default set of flowsheets. The default flowsheets are provided by the parent projects, but user provided flowsheets can always be uploaded through the frontend after installation.
